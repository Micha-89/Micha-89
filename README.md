## I want to work as a web dev in Berlin! More about me: 

 ### What my previous work experience offers: 

 - I worked about 3 years as a recruiter, 4 years as a social law advisor and 2 years as a customer service agent.
 - Clear and good communication, problem solving skills and emphaty were central in all of these. 
 - Detailed work, analytical thinking and being able to communicate complex matter was crucial in my job as a social law advisor.

### Why I changed careers: 

Learning, discovering new things, solving and thinking about complex challenges is what drives me in life. Web development combines analytical thinking, problem solving, and      continous learning in a way that is direct and visible. I started coding in march 2020 and had a feeling that it would align with what drives me. And it really did! 😁 I quit my job to follow the 9 week Ironhack bootcamp. And now here I am, ready for the next big step. 😺

### Web dev experience: 

 - I have experience in the following tech: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, MongoDB, React.
