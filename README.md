## I want to work as a web dev in Berlin!

### You can contact me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-raman/) or by [e-mail](mailto:raman_michael@hotmail.com) for questions and job offers.

### Why I changed careers: 

Learning, discovering new things, and thinking about complex topics is what drives me in life. Web development combines analytical thinking, problem-solving, and continuous learning in a way that is direct and visible. I started coding in march 2020 and had a feeling that it would align with what drives me. And it really did! 😺 I quit my job to follow the 9-week Ironhack bootcamp. And now here I am, ready for the next big step. 🚀

### Where I would feel at 🏠: 

- A fast-paced and dynamic work environment
- A space to learn daily and grow continuously 
- A team where people respect and support each other
- A company where you can take ownership of your work
- An environment where you can feel the motivation and ambition

 ### What my previous work experience offers: 

 - I worked 3 years as a recruiter, 4 years as a social law advisor, and 2 years as a customer service agent.
 - Clear and good communication, problem-solving skills, and empathy were central in all of these jobs. 
 - Detailed work, analytical thinking and being able to communicate about complex subjects was crucial in my job as a social law advisor.

### I have experience with the following web dev tools: 

HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript / ReactJS / NodeJS / ExpressJS / MongoDB / Bootstrap / Git and GitHub / Visual Studio Code / p5.js / Figma

### What I do for fun besides coding:

- I collect old artifacts, love to read about history, and could give guided tours of some archeological musea 😄
- I love video games with deep and complex worlds
- Playing board games with friends
- Long hikes and bike rides around Berlin 🌲🌲🌲
- Enjoying the Berlin nightlife
- Traveling, if there is history and culture involved
